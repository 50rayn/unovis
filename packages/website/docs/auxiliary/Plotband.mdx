This feature is used to highlight a particular region in the spark charts along Y or X axis. It is compatible only with XY and containers.

## Basic configuration

## Orientation

The axis property determines whether the plotband is drawn horizontally or vertically, based on the axis it targets.
* axis: `x` draws a vertical plotband that spans across the y-axis — typically used to highlight a range of x-values (e.g., time periods).
* axis: `y` (default) draws a horizontal plotband that spans across the x-axis — commonly used to highlight a range of y-values (e.g., thresholds or danger zones).

Use this setting to match the orientation of the plotband with the dimension of interest in your chart.

Default: `y` (horizontal)

## Color

The color property sets the fill color of the plotband.

You can provide any valid CSS color value, such as:
* Named colors (e.g., "red", "blue")
* Hex codes (e.g., "#ffcc00")
* RGB / RGBA (e.g., "rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)")
* CSS variables (e.g., `var(--vis-plotband-color)`)

Use this to visually distinguish different plotbands or to align them with your chart’s color theme.

Default: 'var(--vis-plotband-color)'

## Range

The from and to properties define the start and end coordinates of the plotband along the specified axis. These values determine the area to be highlighted:
* from marks the starting point.
* to marks the ending point.
* Both must be set for the plotband to render.
* If from and to are equal, no area is drawn.
* If either is null or undefined, the plotband is skipped.

Default: 0 for both

## Labeling

Plotbands support an optional label to annotate the highlighted area. The labeling system is flexible and includes controls for positioning, orientation, offset, size, and color.

### Label Position

The label can be positioned relative to the plotband rectangle using the labelPosition property. It supports a variety of placements such as inside or outside each side of the plotband area.

Available values include:
* `top-left-inside`, `top-left-outside`
* `top-inside`, `top-outside`
* `top-right-inside`, `top-right-outside`
* `right-inside`, `right-outside`
* `bottom-right-inside`, `bottom-right-outside'
* `bottom-inside`, `bottom-outside`
* `bottom-left-inside`, `bottom-left-outside`
* `left-inside`, `left-outside`

These positions determine the base placement of the label before any offset or orientation is applied.

### Label Orientation

Use the labelOrientation property to control the rotation of the label text. You can choose between:

* `horizontal` (default)
* `vertical`

This setting helps optimize readability depending on the label’s placement.

### Label Offset

You can adjust the label’s position with pixel-based offsets using the `labelOffsetX` and `labelOffsetY` properties. These apply additional horizontal and vertical shifts from the base position.

For example:
* A positive `labelOffsetX` will move the label further right.
* A negative `labelOffsetY` will shift it upward.

This is useful for fine-tuning alignment or preventing overlap with other visual elements.

### Label Font Size

The `labelSize` property controls the font size of the label, specified in pixels.

By default, it uses the CSS variable `--vis-plotband-label-font-size`, which resolves to `12px`. You can override this by providing a number (e.g., 14 for 14px).

### Label Color

To customize the label’s appearance, use the `labelColor` property. This accepts any valid CSS color string such as:
* Named colors: `red`, `black`
* Hex values: `#333`, `#FF8800`
* CSS variables: `var(--vis-text-color)`

If omitted, the label inherits the default text color for the plotband context.
